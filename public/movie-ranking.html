<h1>The Best Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>According to Lorraine</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>What about Bob</h3>
<p>This is a classic movie from the early 90s. I love it because it's hilarious. The tension between Bob (Bill Murrary) and Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) is not just put on for the movie; it's the real deal. This movie relates to people of all ages in all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>Who can argue with this one? The Titanic is packed with drama, romance, comedy, thrills, and action. Rose and Jack are unforgettable characters in the historial fiction retelling of this catastrophic ship wreck.</p>
<h3>Castaway</h3>
<p>Tom Hanks is incredible. He's on screen alone for over an hour in this movie and you can't take your eyes off his capturing performance. Stuck on a deserted island after a plane crash, Chuck learns how to survive.</p>
